<h1> CUSail </h1>
<h2> Business & Operations Lead </h2>

<h3> Background </h3>
    <p> CUSail is a Cornell Engineering project team that designs and builds an
          autonomous robotic sailboat for competition and oceanic research. I am
          the lead of the Business and Operations Subteam, or BOps for short, which
          means I handle all of the team's social media, promotional materials, and
          finances.</p>

    <p> I first joined the team during my first semester at Cornell, when BOps
      was a brand new team with only four members. Even though I was a freshmen,
      I was thrown headfirst into the team's initiative to completely rebrand
      the team, which required a new logo, website, sponsorship packet, and
      social media look. </p>
<h3> Logo Design </h3>
    <p> We wanted to update our overall brand to be something more modern and
    clean. Previously, our logo used heavy nautical motifs, and we were mistaken
    for an actual sailing team fairly often. I just began by just churning out
    as many different ideas as I could, messing around with Illustrator. </p>
    <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/logo1.png" alt="the website color scheme"> </div>
    <p> <strong> Considerations </strong> <br> <br> I really wanted to create two logos: one
    that said CUSail, and one that was just a boat, so it would be easier to fit into
    small places like social media profile pictures. Additonally, both logos would need the
    flexibility to work on light and dark backgrounds. </p>
    <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/logo2.png" alt="the website color scheme"> </div>
    <p> After getting some helpful feedback from the team, I settled on these two logos,
    which we felt best fit the overall mood for the team. Small changes to these logos
    have been made since Fall 2018, but I am still very proud of what I accomplished
    back then.</p>

<!-- <h3> Branding </h3>
    <p> Our website also needed a visual update. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah </p> -->
<h3 id="design"> Other Designs </h3>
    <p> Beyond the initial rebranding of the team in 2018, I have designed promotional
      materials, stickers, and apparel for CUSail. Here is a collection of the work
      I have done over the years, mostly done in Illustrator and Photoshop: </p>

<h3> Videography </h3>
    <p> I've also dabbled a little in videography for the team. Although I have
      little experience with making videos, I have really enjoyed the process of
      creating every video, especially when making the title and lower-third
      animations using After Effects.  </p>
