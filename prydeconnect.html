    <h3> About PRYDE Connect </h3>
        <p> PRYDE Connect is a tool to connect youth development researchers with 4-H practitioners to facilitate collaboration and connection in the field.
        Users can browse past and ongoing studies by research topic, as well as create profiles and post studies of their own.</p>
        <p> PRYDE Connect was originally created for researchers at Cornell University to connect with 4-H practitioners across New York State, but users from other universities and other states are welcome to browse studies and create profiles. </p>
        <p> Over the course of the summer, I worked on everything from the initial sketches and wireframes to the final, high-fidelity design of the website.</p>
    <h3> The Problem </h3>
        <p> Youth development researchers want to collaborate with other professionals in the field, especially 4-H practitioners, but they have a hard time doing that because:
        <strong><!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <ul> -->
            <!-- <li>  -->
                every county's 4-H program is studying different things and
            <!-- </li> -->
            <!-- <li>  -->
                current offerings do not go into detail about an individual's primary research topics or current studies.
            <!-- </li> -->
            <!-- <li> </li> -->
        </strong></p>
        <!-- </ul> -->
    <!-- <h3> Brainstorming </h3> -->
        <!-- <p> </p> -->
    <h3> The Solution </h3>
        <p> We wanted a solution that would allow <em> anyone</em>  to view the research that Cornell faculty and 4-H practitioners were working on, while also promoting connections between the two groups of people. For this purpose, a website made most sense.</p>
        <p> In order to accomplish our goal, we came up with several basic interactions for the website: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Browsing studies </li>
                <li> Browsing people and researchers </li>
                <li> Creating a profile </li>
                <li> Posting a study </li>
            </ul>
        <p> Here are videos displaying the high/medium fidelity flow of the above interations: </p>

    <h3> Visual Design </h3>
        <p> <strong> Colors </strong><br><br> I wanted to keep the visual design to be similar to <a href="https://pryde.bctr.cornell.edu/"> PRYDE's website</a>. Across the entire website, I kept to just PRYDE's three main colors on top of neutral black, white, and gray.</p>
        <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/colors.png"> </div>
        <div class="caption"> <em> The website color scheme. </em> </div>
        <p> One distinction I created was "assigning" green to users who chose 4-H practitioners roles and blue to those who indicated they were researchers. This helps a user to quickly identify a user's role while looking at their profile page or user card. Orange, the third primary color, was used more used as an accent for the graphics on the website. </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/dich.png"> </div>
                <div class="caption"> <em> Two examples of how the color/role pairing was presented: User cards in a study page, and user profiles. </em> </div>
            </div>
        <p> <strong> Form + Action Icons </strong><br><br> To make the different pages and forms more visually appealing, I created icons for research categories, roles, and action icons that appear throughout the website. </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="static-item"style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/action icons.png"> </div>
                <p> These icons appear after a user has created an account or posted a study, with the exception of the "Sign Up" icon on the far right, which appears on the home screen. Neither blue nor green are used in these icons to keep them neutral between the two different user roles.</p>
                <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/roleicons.png"> </div>
                <p> These two icons appear when a user is signing up for an account. A user's role as a researcher or practitioner is one of the first fields they fill in during the sign-up process. These icons are meant to reflect each role while introducing the user to the blue-green dichotomy used in the rest of the website. </p>
                <div class="static-item"> <img src="images/icons.png"> </div>
                <p> Each of these icons represents a youth development research area such as Nutrition, Intergenrational Engagement, and Motivation. Users select from these areas when they initally create a profile. These icons are used to break up the long list of topics are make the sign-up process less tiring and tedious.</p>
