    <h3> About PRYDE Connect </h3>
        <p> PRYDE Connect is a tool to connect youth development researchers with
            4-H practitioners to facilitate collaboration and connection in the field.
        Users can browse past and ongoing studies by research topic, as well as create
        profiles and post studies of their own.</p>
        <p> PRYDE Connect was originally created for researchers at Cornell University
            to connect with 4-H practitioners across New York State, but users from
            other universities and other states are welcome to browse studies and
            create profiles. </p>
        <p> Over the course of the summer, I worked on everything from the initial
            sketches and wireframes to the final, high-fidelity design of the website.</p>
    <h3> The Problem </h3>
        <p> Youth development researchers want to collaborate with other professionals
            in the field, especially 4-H practitioners, but they have a hard time doing
             because:
        <strong><!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <ul> -->
            <!-- <li>  -->
                every county's 4-H program is studying different things and
            <!-- </li> -->
            <!-- <li>  -->
                current offerings do not go into detail about an individual's primary
                 topics or current studies.
            <!-- </li> -->
            <!-- <li> </li> -->
        </strong></p>
        <p>Current alternatives for Cornell faculty and affiliated researchers
            included the <a href=”https://cce.cornell.edu/”>Cornell Cooperative
            Extension (CCE) webpage</a> and <a href=”http://vivo.med.cornell.edu/”>
            VIVO for Weill Cornell Medical College</a>. The CCE webpage
            lists ongoing projects, and provides recent activity and the
            information for each project, but does not go into much detail
            or provide links to more information. VIVO’s website hosts an extensive
            list of affiliated projects and people, but its search and filtering
            functions make it difficult to browse items on a particular research
            interest.</p>
        <!-- </ul> -->
    <h3> Brainstorming </h3>
        <p> We wanted a solution that would allow <em> anyone</em>  to view the
        research that Cornell faculty and 4-H practitioners were working on,
        while also promoting connections between the two groups of people.
         For this purpose, a website made most sense.</p>
        <p>The intended audience members we interviewed were very excited about
        PRYDE Connect, and had a lot of valuable insight into what features
        most useful and important for them. Thanks to their input, we made
        sure to think about the following:</p>
        <p> <strong> Minimum Functionality </strong> <br>
        The minimum viable product for us was to create a platform in which
        users could create profiles with their contact information, and
        post studies that would appear in a list of all studies.</p>
        <p> <strong> Incentivizing Signups </strong> <br>
        In order to create a critical mass for the platform, we wanted to
        ensure that we were creating an environment that suited what users
        wanted to see. From user interviews, we determined that allowing users
        to post completed studies was necessary. This would probably lead to
        a large number of studies, which would make a thorough filtering system
        super important to the usability of the site.</p>
        <p> <strong> Scalability and Scope </strong> <br>
        One potential issue we examined was a mismatch of interest between
        researchers and practitioners, with a greater number of
        practitioners projected to use the site. One option was to open the
        site up to other schools and research institutions. However, there
        were also concerns that such a large scale would take away from the
        tailored puporse to Cornell and NYS 4-H programs.</p>

                and profile pages (right). </em> </div>
        </div>
    <h3> The Solution </h3>
        <p> In order to accomplish our goals, we came up with several basic
            interactions for the website: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Browsing studies </li>
                <li> Browsing people and researchers </li>
                <li> Creating a profile </li>
                <li> Posting a study </li>
            </ul>
        <p> The following two videos demonstrate the high/medium fidelity flow
             the above interations: </p>

    <h3> Visual Design </h3>
        <p> <strong> Colors </strong><br><br> I wanted to keep the visual design to be similar to <a href="https://pryde.bctr.cornell.edu/"> PRYDE's website</a>. Across the entire website, I kept to just PRYDE's three main colors on top of neutral black, white, and gray.</p>
        <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/colors.png" alt="the website color scheme"> </div>
        <div class="caption"> <em> The website color scheme. </em> </div>
        <p> One distinction I created was "assigning" green to users who chose 4-H practitioners roles and blue to those who indicated they were researchers. This helps a user to quickly identify a user's role while looking at their profile page or user card. Orange, the third primary color, was used more used as an accent for the graphics on the website. </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/dich.png" alt="The dual use of green and blue in the website"> </div>
                <div class="caption"> <em> Two examples of how the color/role pairing was presented: User cards in a study page, and user profiles. </em> </div>
            </div>
        <p> <strong> Form + Action Icons </strong><br><br> To make the different pages and forms more visually appealing, I created icons for research categories, roles, and action icons that appear throughout the website. </p>
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/actionicons.png" alt="Action Icons"> </div>
                <p> These icons appear after a user has created an account or posted a study, with the exception of the "Sign Up" icon on the far right, which appears on the home screen. Neither blue nor green are used in these icons to keep them neutral between the two different user roles.</p>
                <div class="static-item" style="width: 100%;"> <img src="images/roleicons.png" alt="role icons"> </div>
                <p> These two icons appear when a user is signing up for an account. A user's role as a researcher or practitioner is one of the first fields they fill in during the sign-up process. These icons are meant to reflect each role while introducing the user to the blue-green dichotomy used in the rest of the website. </p>
                <div class="static-item"> <img src="images/icons.png" alt="Research Interest icons"> </div>
                <p> Each of these icons represents a youth development research area such as Nutrition, Intergenrational Engagement, and Motivation. Users select from these areas when they initally create a profile. These icons are used to break up the long list of topics are make the sign-up process less tiring and tedious.</p>
